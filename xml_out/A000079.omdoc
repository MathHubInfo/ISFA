      <CMP> The mini-sequence b(n) = least number k &gt; 0 such that 2^k ends in n identical digits is given by {1, 18, 39}. The repeating digits are {2, 4, 8} respectively.

The number of n-digit endings for a power of 2 with n or more digits id 4*5^(n-1). Thus, for b(4) to exist, one only needs to check exponents up to 4*5^3 = 500.

The k-values for which 2^k ends in '432' are given by 25 mod 100. For k = 25 + 100*x, the digit immediately before the run of '432' is {4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, ...} for x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}, respectively.
