      <CMP> Signature permutations of DEEPEN-transformations of non-recursive Catalan automorphisms in table A089840.</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> Row n is the signature permutation of the Catalan automorphism which is obtained from the n-th nonrecursive automorphism in the table A089840 with the recursion scheme &quot;DEEPEN&quot;. In this recursion scheme the given automorphism is first applied at the root of general tree, before the algorithm recurses down to all subtrees. I.e., this corresponds to the pre-order (prefix) traversal of a Catalan structure, when it is interpreted as a general tree. The associated Scheme-procedures DEEPEN and !DEEPEN can be used to obtain such a transformed automorphism from any constructively or destructively implemented automorphism. Each row occurs only once in this table. Inverses of these permutations can be found in table A122284.</CMP>
    </omtext><omtext class="comment">
      <CMP> The recursion scheme FORK (described in A122201) is equivalent to a composition of recursion schemes SPINE (described in A122203) and DEEPEN, i.e., FORK(f) = DEEPEN(SPINE(f)) holds for all Catalan automorphisms f. These recursion schemes have well-defined inverses, that is, they are bijective mappings on the set of all Catalan automorphisms. Thus we can equivalently define that DEEPEN(f) = FORK(SPINE^{-1}(f)). Specifically, if g = SPINE(f), then (f s) = (cond ((pair? s) (let ((t (g s))) (cons (car t) (g^{-1} (cdr t))))) (else s)) that is, to obtain an automorphism f which gives g when subjected to recursion scheme SPINE, we compose g with its own inverse applied to the cdr-branch of a S-expression. This implies that for any non-recursive automorphism f in the table A089840, SPINE^{-1}(f) is also in A089840, which in turn implies that the rows of table A122283 form a (proper) subset of the rows of table A122201. E.g., row 1 of A122283 is row 21 of A122201, row 2 of A122283 is row 3613 of A122201, row 17 of A122283 is row 65352 of A122201, row 21 of A122283 is row 251 of A122201. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 25 2007</CMP>
